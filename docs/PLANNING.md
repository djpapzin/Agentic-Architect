# Polyglot Mediator - Project Planning

## Project Vision
Build a multi-agent system that coordinates specialized AI agents to provide high-quality, culturally-aware translations with appropriate tone and legal compliance.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System Architecture
- [ ] **Orchestrator Agent**
  - Coordinates between different specialized agents
  - Manages workflow and data flow
  - Handles error recovery and fallbacks

- [ ] **Language Agent**
  - Handles core translation tasks
  - Manages language detection
  - Ensures linguistic accuracy

- [ ] **Cultural Agent**
  - Adapts content to cultural contexts
  - Identifies culturally sensitive content
  - Suggests culturally appropriate alternatives

- [ ] **Legal Agent**
  - Flags legally sensitive content
  - Ensures compliance with regional regulations
  - Provides disclaimers where needed

- [ ] **Tone Agent**
  - Adjusts tone (formal, friendly, assertive, etc.)
  - Maintains consistent tone throughout the translation
  - Adapts tone based on cultural context

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services (Stretch, post-MVP)
- [ ] Set up Coral Protocol integration (MCP servers per agent)
- [ ] Implement agent communication protocol / orchestrator service
- [ ] Optional: Create API proxy endpoint `/mediate`
- [ ] Caching layer for performance (if backend is added)

### Frontend Development (MVP now)
- [x] Design and implement basic UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
- [ ] Create agent selection controls (expanded)
- [ ] Display mediated result with loading state and rationales
- [ ] Implement presets, sessions, and local persistence

### Infrastructure (Hackathon scope)
- [x] Set up development environment (UI-only)
- [ ] Basic CI (optional)
- [ ] Plan for scalability (out of hackathon scope)

## Team Roles & Responsibilities

### Team Member 1: Backend & Agent Development
- Implement core agent logic
- Set up Coral Protocol integration
- Design agent communication protocol
- Optimize performance

### Team Member 2: Frontend & UX

- Implement real-time updates
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

### Team Member 3: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Write unit and integration tests
- Perform user acceptance testing
- Monitor system performance
- Document test cases

## Milestones

### Week 1: Foundation

- [ ] Create initial UI mockups
- [ ] Set up development environment

### Week 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement basic translation flow
- [ ] Connect agents to Coral Protocol
- [ ] Create functional UI
- [ ] Implement basic error handling

### Week 3: Refinement
- [ ] Add cultural adaptation features
- [ ] Implement tone adjustment
- [ ] Add legal compliance checks
- [ ] Optimize performance

### Week 4: Polish & Launch
- [ ] Conduct user testing
- [ ] Fix critical bugs
- [ ] Optimize for production
- [ ] Prepare demo and documentation

## Technical Dependencies
- Coral Protocol SDK
- Node.js / Express.js
- Frontend framework (e.g., React/Vue)
- Testing framework (Jest/Mocha)

## Risk Assessment
1. **Risk**: Agent communication overhead
   **Mitigation**: Implement efficient message passing and caching

2. **Risk**: Cultural inaccuracies
   **Mitigation**: Include validation from native speakers

3. **Risk**: Performance bottlenecks
   **Mitigation**: Implement caching and optimize agent operations

## Next Steps
1. Assign team members to roles
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin implementing agent skeletons
4. Create initial UI wireframes
